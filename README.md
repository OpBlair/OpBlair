👋 Hi, I’m Tonny Blair

👀 I’m passionate about using code to solve problems and bring ideas to life. My interests include **web development, computer hardware & robotics, cybersecurity, and tech for social impact**.

🌱 I’m currently learning **computer science** and sharpening my skills in **full-stack web development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) while exploring AI, networking, and server management.

💞️ I’m open to collaborating on **open-source projects** in web development, cybersecurity, AI, and robotics.

⚡ Fun fact: I break bugs faster than I break promises… most days. Oh, and I might have *slight* commitment issues 😂
